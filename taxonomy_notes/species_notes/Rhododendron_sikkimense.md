## Remarks  
Original publication did not cite a holotype so is invalidly published. Pradhan attempted? to validate the publication, but created a nom. nov. with the an correctable orthogtaphic variant -ensis and cited the Edinburgh specimen as a Lectotype rather than a holotype. I am not sure if this is enough to validate or it has caused more problems. IPNI notified.
