## Description
Very low, probably creeping shrublet. Twigs slender, tips densely covered with stalked scales or rough in the lower parts where the scales have gone. Leaves spiral or sub-opposite. Blade 7–10 x 5–8mm, broadly obovate to sub-circular; apex rounded or minutely retuse; margin entire, not or very slightly recurved; base broadly tapering or mostly rounded, laxly scaly initially, early glabrescent above, persistently scaly beneath. Scales circular, entire, flat, the large, dark, centre slightly impressed. Mid-vein impressed above, prominent beneath; lateral veins obscure. Petiole 1.5–2mm. Bracts elliptic-obovate, sparsely hairy outside, densely white-ciliate on the margins. Inflorescence of solitary or rarely paired flowers. Pedicels 5–6mm, slender, densely scaly. Calyx small, obscurely 5-lobed. Corolla 17–20 x 3–4mm, tubular, sub-densely scaly all over outside, glabrous inside; lobes c.4 x 3mm, obovate to sub-circular, with an entire margin. Stamens nearly equalling the corolla in length; filaments linear, glabrous; anthers 1mm. Disc glabrous. Ovary c.3mm, sub-conical, densely scaly, tapering distally; style laxly scaly in the proximal ¼, glabrous distally, equalling or slightly exceeding the corolla in length; stigma club-shaped.
