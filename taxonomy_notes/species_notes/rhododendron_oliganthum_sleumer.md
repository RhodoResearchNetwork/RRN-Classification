## Description
Shrub, c.1.2m. Twigs rounded, slender, tips densely reddish-brown-scaly; upper internodes 1.5–3cm. Leaves in tight pseudowhorls of 2–3 at the upper node only, sub-sessile. Blade 30–50 x 15–30mm, sub-ovate-­elliptic; apex shortly acuminate, obtuse; margin recurved; base truncate to rounded or sub-cordate, glabrescent above at maturity, laxly scaly beneath. Scales thin, marginal zone irregularly dentate; centre slightly impressed. Mid-vein faintly impressed or nearly flat above, strongly raised beneath proximally, less so distally; lateral veins c.8 per side, straight, curved-anastomosing near the margin, prominent on both sides, lax reticulation, raised especially beneath. Petiole 1–2 x 1–1.5mm. Flowers solitary or in twos, terminal. Pedicels 28–30mm, thick, obliquely thickened below the calyx, scaly and very shortly hairy. Calyx c.2.5mm in diameter, shortly 5-lobed and wavy. Corolla broadly trumpet-shaped, pink; tube 35–37 x c.4 x 5–6mm, cylindrical, straight, laxly scaly and very laxly short-hairy outside, sub-densely hairy inside in the proximal part, less so distally, glabrous at the mouth; lobes 10–12mm in diameter, spreading, broadly obovate to nearly circular, scaly outside at the base, otherwise glabrous. Stamens slightly exserted from the throat; filaments linear, sub-densely to laxly hairy in the proximal 2/3, glabrous distally; anthers c.2.6 x 1mm, oblong, base obtuse. Disc hairy especially at the upper margin. Ovary c.7 x 2mm, elongate-conical, densely hairy and scaly, with 5 longitudinal furrows, gradually tapering distally; style c.35mm, slightly exserted, laxly hairy and very laxly scaly to the middle, glabrous distally; stigma thickly conical-globose.
