Scales small, marginal zone irregularly dentate; centre a little impressed. Mid-vein somewhat impressed above, strongly prominent beneath; lateral veins 8–10 per side, irregular, straight below, curved-anastomosing before the margin, slightly impressed above, hardly prominent beneath, smaller veins laxly reticulate, raised beneath only. Petiole 10–15 x c.2mm, grooved above. Bracts to 40 x 18mm, obovate-elliptic, hairy outside in the middle and with longer and appressed hairs in the lower part on both sides. Bracteoles 30–50mm, filiform, hairy. Inflorescence 6–9-flowered. Pedicels c.5mm, thick, scaly. Calyx minute, oblique, circular, obscurely 5-lobed.
