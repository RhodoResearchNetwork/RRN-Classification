# Rhododendron lampongum Miq.

## Description
Shrub. Twigs robust, rounded, tips densely brown-scaly, glabrescent below; internodes 3–11cm. Leaves 5–6 together in pseudowhorls. Blade 40–95 x 20–45mm, narrowly ovate to elliptic; apex shortly to sub-caudately acuminate, broadly acute; margin revolute in dry specimens; base tapering, dark green above, brownish green underneath, practically glabrous above at maturity, dark brown or reddish-scaly beneath. Scales very dense, touching and overlapping with broad lobed flanges and small centres, leaving small pits when they disappear. Mid-vein strongly impressed above, very prominent beneath; lateral veins c.8 per side, irregular, spreading, straight below, anastomosing towards the edge, slightly impressed above in mature leaves, minutely or not raised beneath, visible above only. Petiole 10–25 x 1.5–3mm, semi-rounded, grooved above, densely scaly. Flower buds ovate-apiculate as in R. album. Bracts to 16 x 6mm; outer bracts ovate, abruptly and longish apiculate or subulate, inner ones elliptic-spathulate, obtuse, all scaly outside. Bracteoles to 15mm, linear, laxly scaly. Pedicels 10–15mm, thick, densely brown-scaly and laxly short-hairy. Calyx c.4mm in diameter, obtusely shortly 5-lobed, densely scaly. Corolla 18–20mm, campanulate, yellow; tube c.15 x 3–4 x 6–7mm, laxly scaly outside; lobes broadly obovate-spathulate, spreading, 7–9 x 6–8mm. Stamens 14–16mm; filaments linear, patently long-hairy in the proximal 1⁄3, glabrous distally; anthers 2 x 1mm, broadly oblong. Disc glabrous at the base, densely hairy upwards. Ovary c.4 x 2mm, obovoid-cylindrical, tapering at the base, densely scaly and patently hairy, gradually narrowed distally; style nearly as long as the corolla, slender, scaly and patently hairy in the proximal 1⁄3, conspicuously hairy in the middle, glabrous in the distal 1⁄3 stigma indistinctly lobed. Fruit (sub-mature) c.18 x 3mm, obovoid-fusiform, long-tapering to the base, broadest in the upper 1⁄3, sub-densely scaly and patently hairy.
