# Rhododendron pachystigma Sleumer

## Description
Shrub to 1.5m. Twigs 3–5mm in diameter, semi-rounded, densely scaly at first, older parts often whitish; internodes 4–13cm. Leaves in loose pseudowhorls. Blade 50–90 x 25–50mm, obovate or elliptic-obovate; apex rounded, sometimes slightly retuse; margin entire, revolute proximally, otherwise flat; base broadly tapering; at first densely scaly on both sides, quickly glabrescent both above and below. Scales small, reddish, sessile and flat, fragile, marginal zone irregularly sub-stellately lobed; centre minute, hardly or not impressed. Mid-vein thick and grooved proximally above, as strong as the petiole proximally beneath; lateral veins 8–9 per side, straight, at an angle of c.45° and sub-parallel proximally, curved and joining before the margin, faintly impressed above, a little raised beneath, reticulation obscure. Petiole 10–25 x c.2mm, densely scaly initially. Immature bracts laxly scaly outside, without hairs. Bracteoles to 15mm, filiform, glabrous. Inflorescence 2–3-flowered. Pedicels 8–14 x 1.5–2mm, with dense, small brown scales and fine short hairs in the proximal ¾, distally more densely and with longer hairs. Calyx 6–7mm in diameter, an oblique rim with irregular spreading, triangular lobes, up to 4mm, hairy and scaly along the margin. Corolla 70–80mm, funnel-shaped, deeply 6–7-lobed, light orange on the tube outside, white at the lobes, fleshy; tube 25–30 x 8–9 x 20–25mm, straight, pouched at the base, glabrous outside, densely white-hairy proximally inside; lobes 45–50 x 25–35mm, obovate-spathulate, spreading. Stamens 12–14, unequal, exserted; filaments linear, proximally densely white-hairy, filiform and glabrous distally; anthers c.8 x 1–1.2mm, hinged, elongate-oblong, base obtuse. Disc prominent, densely white-hairy on the margin. Ovary 8–9 x c.4mm, thickly cylindrical, with reddish-brown stellate scales, without hairs, tapering distally; style c.40 x 1–1.5mm, glabrous; stigma rounded, 6–9mm in diameter, with 6–7 thick, sub-globular lobes.
