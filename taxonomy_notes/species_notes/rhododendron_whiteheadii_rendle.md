Blade 25–40 x 15–35mm, elliptic, obovate, or ovate; apex rounded, sometimes minutely emarginate, and sometimes with a minutely protruding terminal gland; margin entire or slightly irregular, flat or narrowly and weakly revolute; base tapering, slightly decurrent; laxly to sub-densely scaly on both sides at first, quickly glabrescent above, more persistently scaly beneath. Scales variable in size, the largest irregularly lobed, with small dark brown centres, smaller ones, circular dark brown, all impressed in shallow pits. Mid-vein impressed above, smooth, shallowly impressed or weakly prominent beneath (distinctly raised when dry); lateral veins 4–6 per side, emerging at c.45°, often only faintly visible above, smooth and faintly visible beneath, reticulation inconspicuous. Petiole 4–5 x 1–1.5mm, grooved above, flattened, brown-scaly and sometimes minutely hairy. Bracts 9–13 x 6–8mm, ovate, obtuse, laxly hairy outside, fringed with dark brown scales.
