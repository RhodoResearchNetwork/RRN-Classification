All taxonomic decisions are made by the RRN community.

Taxonomic proposals should be submitted as issues, which will be voted on monthly. Proposals may be commented upon in the issue tracker. Voting is carried out separately via a Google Form survey circulated on the PPG mailing list. Any proposal receiving >2/3 support will be approved and implemented in the data.

Anybody is welcome to contribute. All participants must adhere to the Code of Conduct. Please read the Project Guidelines before contributing.

Nomenclatural and taxonomic curation of the checklist will happen in Rhakhis, the World Flora Online's taxonomic backbone curation tool.

The key difference between Rhakhis and the public-facing WFO portals is that Rhakhis shows the current data, whereas the portals show snapshots of the data that are released on the solstices 21st of June and December.

The primary function of Rhakhis is to edit the WFO nomenclatural and classification data; however, you may also use it to browse the current data.

Rhakhis requires a ORCID for login. Anybody may create an [OCRID](https://orcid.org/register). Although anybody with an ORCID may login to Rhakhis and browse the data, only authorized users may edit the data. 

The use of Rhaksis allow us to maintain names at the species level in an effective manner, and credit those involved via the WFO data releases.
