# RRN-Classification
Workspace for developing the RRN global checklist

# OVERVIEW

To support the work of the Rhododendron research and conservation communities, we will update the Rhododendron checklist in the World Flora Online (WFO). 
We will curate the taxonomic backbone in the WFO by expanding it to include updated nomenclatural information from a variety of existing data sources. 
We will disambiguate common orthographic variants within the database and present an overview of these.
Our goal is to create the most robust database of Rhododendron names and thereby provide a reliable reference for initiatives in research and conservation. 
We will recruit participants and distribute information about this project and products arising from this work via the Rhododendron Research Network.

# INTENDED PRODUCTS

We will create a comprehensive and maintained checklist of *_Rhododendron_*.
We will continually mataintain and improve the data in the *World Flora Online* for each of thier 6-monthly releases https://www.worldfloraonline.org/.
We will archive checklist in the Rhododendron Research Network Zenodo archive https://zenodo.org/communities/rhododendron/records.
We will enhance our existing Zotero literature database https://www.zotero.org/groups/4735534/rhodo-research.net. 
We will create a webpage within the Rhododendron Research Network Website with links to all of these resources. 
We will publish a paper in an academic journal to disseminate this work.

# Contributing

All taxonomic decisions are made by the RRN community.

Taxonomic proposals should be submitted as issues, which will be voted on monthly. Proposals may be commented upon in the issue tracker. Voting is carried out separately via a Google Form survey circulated on the PPG mailing list. Any proposal receiving >2/3 support will be approved and implemented in the data.


# Code of Conduct

All participants agree to adhere to the [code of conduct](docs\Code of Conduct.md).

# Why GitHub?

GitHub provides tools to allow us to have open, collaborative discussions of taxonomic proposals, and to maintain a record of those discussions publicly available in perpetuity.

# Why Rhakhis?

The use of Rhaksis allow us to maintain names at the species level in an effective manner, and credit those involved via the WFO data releases. The 6-month releases by the WFO gives us discrete deadlines in the year to aim for.
