# RRN-Classification
Workspace for developing the RRN global checklist


# Contributing

All taxonomic decisions are made by the RRN community.

Taxonomic proposals should be submitted as issues, which will be voted on monthly. Proposals may be commented upon in the issue tracker. Voting is carried out separately via a Google Form survey circulated on the PPG mailing list. Any proposal receiving >2/3 support will be approved and implemented in the data.

Anybody is welcome to contribute. All participants must adhere to the Code of Conduct. Please read the Project Guidelines before contributing.

# Why GitHub?

GitHub provides tools to allow us to have open, collaborative discussions of taxonomic proposals, and to maintain a record of those discussions publicly available in perpetuity.

# Why Rhakhis?

The use of Rhaksis allow us to maintain names at the species level in an effective manner, and credit those involved via the WFO data releases. The 6-month releases by the WFO gives us discrete deadlines in the year to aim for.
